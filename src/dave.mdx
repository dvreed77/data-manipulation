# Time Series Featurizer

When working with Time Series data, you need to use the data you have available now, or in the past, to predict your target variable in the future. The time series featurizer works to build a feature matrix by transforming the original user data into a feature matrix that is suitable for a traditional machine learning problem.

## User Data

<div class="flex ">
  <div class="w-1/2">
    Imagine that a user uploads a CSV file with the following data:
  </div>
  <div class="w-1/2">
    <Counter />
  </div>
</div>

MDX allows Rich React components to be used directly in Markdown: <Counter/>
